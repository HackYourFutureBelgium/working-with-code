## Prep Work

- [ ] Watch at least the first 3 videos of [Git & GitHub for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV). This is an outstanding video series that will help you understand why you need Git & GitHub, with no code!
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with the [Homework Submission Process](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/students/homework-submission) here at HYF.
- [ ] Review [the HYF Be Precourse](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/curriculum/precourse), come ready with any questions!

### Group Project

#### Group Intro Repo

Get a feel for your programming environment by writing and pushing a repository of Markdown files.  By the end of class each of you should have create a new repository containing a short intro to each member of your group, and a live demo hosted with GitHub Pages.  It should look like this, but hopefully a little nicer ;)

To Help you get a hang of the homework submission process and to make sure you get everything done, we've provided a template issue in your class repository. If you haven't already head over there, create a new issue from the template, and add it to your class' `Working with Code` project board.

### HYF Directory

Set up a new directory _on your computer_ to host all of the code you write while at HYF. It should look something like this, but feel free to change it as you find what works for you!

```

### Markdown Home Page

Create a home page using markdown (not HTML/CSS!) in the `<username>.github.io` repository on your GitHub account. Later on you can turn this repository into an amazing portfolio web site, but for now stick with the basics :)

#### Writing The Documents

The writing process should look something like this:

1. Create a [new repository on your github account named `<username>.github.io`](https://guides.github.com/features/pages) (with or without a `README.md`)
1. [Turn on GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages)
1. Clone the repository to your computer using GitKraken
1. Open the repository in VSC
1. Open or create the `README.md` file, turn on [Markdown Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dmodalek.markdown-preview-github-styles-custom)
1. Begin writing. Play around with tables, lists, links, emphasis, ... and there's not really much more to Markdown!

This make this exercise too difficult! The main goal is to become familiar adding/committing, pushing/pulling, using VSC, and writing clean code.

If you want an extra challenge try adding some extra pages to your site and linking between them. In the repository this will show up as multiple files above the README, on GitHub Pages this will become a fully navigable web page!

Can you figure out how to make something like a header/navbar using only Markdown?

> Emojis and images won't show up in VSC previews but will show up on GitHub when you push. If you want to get extra creative by including images or emoji's, you'll need to push your code to GitHub frequently to see how it looks when it's live in the repo.

#### Creating a Live Home Page

[Turn on GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages), that's all you need to do to create a live web page!

After turning on GitHub pages, add this link as your home page on your github user profile (if you don't already have a personal web site).

Looking for a little more flare? Set [a theme](https://pages.github.com/themes/) for your home page.

### _Learnables_ Project Board

Create a [user-owned project board](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-a-project-board#creating-a-user-owned-project-board) called **learnables** for you to keep track of your progress at HYF. Here's a suggestion for what columns to use:

1. **Unclear**: things you want to learn at some point, but don't yet have much understanding of
1. **Basic Understanding**: Things you already kind of understand but aren't comfortable doing
1. **Currently Studying**: The things you are actively learning and practicing. There should never be more than ~5-6 cards in this column, if there are you should take some time to refocus your learning
1. **Comfortable**: You are comfortable using these skills/tools in your own projects & exercises, but maybe don't understand them completely
1. **Confident**: You know these things well enough that you'd be able to help the next group of HYF students with their homework

### student-bios Pull Request

Send a Pull Request to your class repository with a short bio so your classmates and coaches can get to know you. You can find more instructions for this in the `/student-bios` directory of your class repo.
