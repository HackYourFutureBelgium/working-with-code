Welcome to your first day of Hack Your Future!

The main goal of this first Sunday is to meet each other, to give you an idea of what to expect from your time at HYF, and to make sure you have everything in place to get started on the homework on Monday morning (or even Sunday night!).  You can expect that we will do very little coding and a lot of clicking.

We'll make sure you have all the correct software installed, that you know how to download and upload your homework to GitHub, that you know how to edit and open HTML & CSS on your computer, that you know how to submit your work, and that you understand what a good finished project will look like.

## Introductions

> ~20 min

Introductions all around!  Current students, new students, alumni, HYF team, we'll do a first round of names and intros.  Of course it'll take a while to get to know each other, but a name and some background is a good start :)

## Learning Objectives

> ~10 min

In today's lesson, we won't be covering everything you're expected to learn this week.  That's just not possible!  We'll be focusing instead on getting you started with the key skills you'll need to _begin_ and _submit_ your homework.  You'll have to figure out how to _complete_ the homework over the week :)

* What you can expect from your time at HYF
* How to create GitHub issues and add them to projects boards
* Creating, forking, cloning & pushing repositories
* Editing code in VSC, previewing your changes, and committing with GitKraken
* Unicorn Rule!

## Software Check

> ~ 20 minutes

Let's take a moment to make sure everyone's computers are set up correctly.  Split into groups of 3-4 and help each other install all of the softwares [in this list](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/working-with-code/blob/master/week-1-homework.md#software-installations).  Coaches and current students will come around to help you out.

No worries if you don't finish on time!  Make note of how far you are through the list and finish with the installations tonight or Monday.

## HYF Directory

> ~20 min

Now that your softwares are (mostly) set up, it's time to start a new folder on your computer you will use to organize your work while with us.  You can find more detailed instructions [right here](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/working-with-code/blob/master/week-1-homework.md#hyf-directory)

There should be enough time to complete this in class.

# Markdown

> ~10 min

Markdown is the only language you will need for this week's assignment.  It's not difficult to learn, but it is important to write clean Markdown!  Nothing screams "I'm a beginner!" like incorrect Markdown in a project README.

While it's not a complicated language, writing good markdown documents is a good test of your self-discipline. One of the main goals of this week's assignment is to practice using live previews and linters in VSC to write clean and readable Markdown.  So don't get carried away with fancy effects, impress us with tidy simplicity!

Enough talking, on to [the code-alongs](https://hackyourfuture.be/working-with-code/week-1.html#markdown).

## GitHub Practice

> ~60 minutes

__Does everyone have a GitHub account?__

__Why do you need GitHub?__


__Some guided practice__
Here are few practice workflows to step through. Expect this all to take at least 45 (very well spent!) minutes:
* Creating a New Repository & using GitHub Pages
    1. [create a new repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-new-repository) with a README.md
    1. [turn on github pages](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41253371/how-do-i-turn-a-repository-into-a-github-page)
    1. Put your github pages url [in your repo's description](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7757751/how-do-you-change-a-repository-description-on-github) and see the live site! (you might need to wait a minute for this to go live)
    1. [Create a new file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-new-files) called "index.html" with some text in it
    1. Check your GitHub Pages link again! (you might have to wait a minute to see the changes)
* Forking a Repository:
    1. fork [this repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/my-first-fork/) - (here's [a helpful link](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo))
    1. [Turn on GitHub Pages](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41253371/how-do-i-turn-a-repository-into-a-github-page) from the "settings" tab of your fork
    1. Paste your fork's URL into the description of your repository
    1. Check out your fork's "network" tab like in the last step of [Pull Requesting](./Pull-Requesting)
    1. Check out [our main repository's](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/my-first-fork/settings) "network" tab like in the last step of [Pull Requesting](./Pull-Requesting)
* [Practice Pull Requesting](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/git-github-practice/wiki/Pull-Requesting)
* [Pushing and Pulling with GitKraken](https://support.gitkraken.com/working-with-repositories/pushing-and-pulling/)
    1. Create a new repository with a README
    1. Clone the repository with GitKraken
    1. Open the new folder in Visual Studio Code
    1. Add a new file called ```index.html```
    1. Commit your changes with GitKraken
    1. Push your changes with GitKraken
    1. Turn on GitHub Pages to host he new file!

## Homework Launch

> ~45 min

Together we'll read over the [Homework Submission Process](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/homework-submission), then get started with the week's homework!

1. Create a GitHub account (if you haven't yet) so we can add you all as contributors in your class repositories.
1. Create an issue in your class repository using the first-week template, and move it to the first column of this module's homework project board.
1. Fork the [`hack-my-future` repo](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/working-with-code/blob/master/week-1-homework.md#hack-my-future) and clone it into your new HYF directory. You can complete the rest of the steps on your own over the week.
1. Fork your class repository and begin [writing your student bio](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/working-with-code/blob/master/week-1-homework.md#student-bios-pull-request). You can send the pull request later in the week once your bio is complete.
