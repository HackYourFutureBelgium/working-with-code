Welcome to Hack Your Future Belgium. There is a lot of code, links, and browser tabs in your near future!

It'll take a little while to learn how to keep this all organized in your head and on your computer.  If you're having trouble finding something, take a look through the links in your class repository. If you still cant find it, ask your classmates on Slack and someone will help you out!

This module's main objective is to get you comfortable with the workflows of programming and of Hack Your Future BE. The finished project won't be complex or impressive to the casual observer, but in order for you to complete it you will need to have a basic overview of the entire development process. Including: ideation, local development, pushing and pulling to github, and hosting static web pages.

## Week 1

Learn to `add` and `commit` local changes, then `push` and `pull` from GitHub.

Master HYF workflows including `individual` issues and Wednesday Check-Ins.

<details>

### Before Class

- Review [the HYF Be Precourse](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/curriculum/precourse), come ready with any questions!
- Watch at least the first 3 videos of [Git & GitHub for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV). This is an outstanding video series that will help you understand why you need Git & GitHub, with no code!
- Familiarize yourself with [HYF Individual Assignments](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/students/individual-assignments).
- [Markdown CheatSheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)
- Group Repo Examples
  - [HackYourFutureBelgium](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/group-intro-example)

- [relative vs. absolute paths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ephId3mYu9o)

### During Class


#### Before Break

Get to know your group and your local programming environment by writing and a folder of Markdown files.  By break time each of you should have created a new directory in your computer just for HackYourFuture, and one new folder inside it containing a short intro to each member of your group.  It should look something like this, but hopefully a little nicer ;)

- [Example Repo](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/group-intro-example)

Writing code is still writing!
Take the time to proof read and edit your code. Your colleagues and your future self will thank you. Practice using the VSC plugins you installed with the Precourse to write correct markdown:

- Correct your spelling with Code Spell Checker
- Format your code with Prettier
- Fix any linting errors
- Preview the rendered Markdown, does it look like you wanted?

#### After Break

Create a repository on your GitHub account and push your new markdown folder to GitHub, finally turn on GitHub Pages for a live preview:

- [Example Live](https://hackyourfuture.be/group-intro-example)

You may use the Terminal or GitKraken for this, whatever you find easier.

__Create `individual Issue__

Before moving on, you will need to [create an `individual` issue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ll-5wYxg3A&feature=youtu.be) for this module:

- [step-by-step video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ll-5wYxg3A&feature=youtu.be)
- [New Issue] in the issues tab of your class repo
- Use the _individual_ template
- More details in the [student guidebook](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/students/individual-assignments#individual-issues)

---

## After Class

Rebuild your home page (`username.github.io`) using HTML & CSS.  Anything goes, impress yourself!

Here's a checklist you can paste into your [`individual` issue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ll-5wYxg3A&feature=youtu.be) to track your progress:

```markdown
- [ ] [Repository](https://github.com/your-user-name/your-user-name.github.io)
- [ ] [Live Demo](https://your-user-name.github.io)
- [ ] [Complete README](https://github.com/your-user-name)
- [ ] _NO_ CSS in your HTML file
```

## Week 2

Learn a basic branching workflow:

1. set up your repository and clone it
2. for each file in your group repository
   1. create a new branch locally
   2. write your new code on that branch
   3. push the branch to your repository
   4. create a PR & merge the branch to `master`
   5. pull the new `master` branch to your computer
   6. continue to the next step

### Before Class

- Git
  - [Git & GitHub for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV): 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.6 & 1.7
  - [learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org):
    - Main, Introduction Sequence: 1, 2, 3
    - Remotes, Pull & Push: 1 -> 6
  - [Understand how to use Atomic Commits](https://curiousprogrammer.io/blog/how-to-craft-your-changes-into-small-atomic-commits-using-git)

### During Class

#### Before Break

Build _another_ group intro repository?!  Your main focus this time will be understanding _git branches_ to organize your development

While in your small groups each group member will create _their own_ repository.  You can help each other all you need to, but you will each need to work on a separate project. There is no need to use fork each other's repos.

By break time you should each have:

1. (GitHub) An empty repository
2. (your computer) A clone of your repository with:
   1. A development strategy ([a starter file](./development-strategies/1-individual-strategy.md))
   2. A main readme
   3. One branch per group member with an introduction file

#### After Break

Time to push and merge!  In this part of class you will practice pushing to GitHub, creating pull requests, and merging branches.  By the end of class each of you should be on your way to having something [like this repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/team-branchies).

No worries if you can't finish all at once.  You'll have the rest of the week to practice and finish ;)

## After Class


This week's project is **_individual_**. You will study and reverse-engineer the [__acme-web-design__ tutorial from Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm6CUkswsNw).

Writing the same code as Mr. Traversy's code is not enough! You are expected to submit your code from his tutorial in a new repository on your GitHub account using [this template repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/w3-validation-template) (about [generating with templates](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/)). Your repository should be named `acme-web-design`.

You are expected to write a wireframe to describe your website (see [Suggested Study](#suggested-study)).  You will use this wireframe to break your project into small steps. For example you may develop the header first, then the footer, ...

After creating your wireframe you should cleanly develope your project with one branch per step.  It's up to you to decide what the steps are and in what order to build them.

Your workflow for this project should be the same workflow you practiced in class.  For each step in your project you should develop on a new branch. After completing the code for one step (on one branch) you should push that branch to GitHub and merge to master using a Pull Request.

A good strategy for completing this project is the __three-step__:

1. follow the tutorial studying the code and understanding the project.
2. look over your finished code and break it down into steps, write your development strategy.
3. study the tutorial a second time, following your strategy to build your repository one branch at a time

You will be assessed not only on your live demo, but also on the quality of your code, your development strategy, the correctness of your branches, and the completeness of your repository. Your repository must contain:

### Issue Checklist

Copy-paste this checklist into your individual issue in the **Week 1** section:

```md
- [ ] [repo](https://github.com/_/_)
- [ ] [complete README](https://github.com/_/_)
- [ ] link to wireframe in README
- [ ] [live demo](https://_.github.io/_)
- [ ] [one branch per step](https://github.com/_/_/network)
- [ ] [one closed PR per step](https://github.com/_/_/pulls)
```
