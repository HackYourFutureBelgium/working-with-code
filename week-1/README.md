## Prep Work

Materials to read, review, and practice before coming into class/

1. Watch at least the first 3 videos of [Git & GitHub for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV).  This is an outstanding video series that will help you understand why you need Git & GitHub, with no code!
3. Familiarize yourself with the [Homework Submission Process](http://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/homework-submission) here at HYF.
2. Look through [the HYF Be Precourse](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/precourse).

## Assignments

Not all assignments are created equal.  These 3 emoji's will help you figure out how to spend your study time before HYF as effectively as possible.
* :egg: ```:egg:``` - these assignments are required, they cover the base skills you'll need to move on.
* :hatching_chick: ```:hatching_chick:``` - do your best to start these exercises. you don't need to finish or master them but getting the main idea will prepare you for success
* :hatched_chick: ```:hatched_chick:``` - Have you finished all the :egg:'s and :hatching_chick:'s? push yourself with these challenges!


There are 6 assignments, 2 on your computer and 4 on GitHub:

1. :egg: [(computer) Software Installations](#software-installations)
1. :egg: [(computer) Start an HYF Directory](#hyf-directory)
1. :egg: [(GitHub) _Learnables_ Project Board](#learnables-project-board)
1. :egg: [(GitHub) Pull Request to "student-bios"](#student-bios-pull-request)
1. :egg: [(GitHub) Set Up Your hack-my-future Repo](#hack-my-future)
1. :egg: [(GitHub) Push Your Markdown Home Page](#markdown-home-page)

To Help you get a hang of the homework submission process and to make sure you get everything done, we've provided a template issue in your class repository.  If you haven't already head over there, create a new issue from the template, and add it to your class' `Working with Code` project board.

### Software Installations

Make sure you have all of these softwares installed on your computer:

* [Chromium](https://download-chromium.appspot.com/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) & [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/): All great browsers with ES6, HTML5 & CSS3 support plus pre-installed, top-knotch developer tools. Be sure to test your projects on all 3!
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download): Like Microsoft Word, but for code ...  and _sooooo_ much better.  After installing VSC, be sure to install these plug-ins:
    * [Markdown Preview Github Styles](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-preview-github-styles)
    * [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)
    * [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode#overview)
    * [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
* [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/download): A program that will help you master using git.
* (If you have windows) [Git For Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/): This will allow you to use the same terminal commands & tools as Linux or Mac computers.
* Slack: How you will communicate with HYF, classmates & coaches
   * For Mobile: [App store](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/slack/id803453959?mt=12) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Slack&hl=nl)
   * For Desktop: [OSX](https://slack.com/downloads/osx), [Linux](https://slack.com/intl/en-be/downloads/linux) or [Windows](https://slack.com/downloads/windows)

> If you have a Windows machine, it's recommended that you set up your computer for dual booting Linux.  Windows will work fine at the beginning of the course, but later on will make things more difficult for you. Get in touch with one of your coaches if you'd like to get this set up already.

### HYF Directory

Set up a new directory *on your computer* to host all of the code you write while at HYF.  It should look something like this, but feel free to change it as you find what works for you!

```
--/ Documents
  |-/ HYF
    |-/ hack-my-future
    |   (see the hack-my-future assignment for more info on this folder)
    |-/ 00-working-with-code
    |-/ 01-incremental-development
    :
    :
```

### _Learnables_ Project Board

Create a [user-owned project board](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-a-project-board#creating-a-user-owned-project-board) called __learnables__ for you to keep track of your progress at HYF.  Here's a suggestion for what columns to use:

1. __Unclear__: things you want to learn at some point, but don't yet have much understanding of
1. __Basic Understanding__: Things you already kind of understand but aren't comfortable doing
1. __Currently Studying__: The things you are actively learning and practicing. There should never be more than ~5-6 cards in this column, if there are you should take some time to refocus your learning
1. __Comfortable__: You are comfortable using these skills/tools in your own projects & exercises, but maybe don't understand them completely
1. __Confident__: You know these things well enough that you'd be able to help the next group of HYF students with their homework


### student-bios Pull Request

Send a Pull Request to your class repository with a short bio so your classmates and coaches can get to know you.  You can find more instructions for this in the `/student-bios` directory of your class repo.

### hack-my-future

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the [hack-my-future repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/hack-my-future).
1. [Pin](https://github.blog/2016-06-16-pin-repositories-to-your-github-profile/) it to your GitHub account
1. Set up your `learnables` project board, as described in the [hack-my-future repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/hack-my-future)
1. [Clone the repository](https://support.gitkraken.com/working-with-repositories/open-clone-init/) into your `HYF` directory (with GitKraken)
1. Begin organizing your learning!

### Markdown Home Page

Create a home page using markdown (not HTML/CSS!) in the `<username>.github.io` repository on your GitHub account. Later on you can turn this repository into an amazing portfolio web site, but for now stick with the basics :)

#### Writing The Documents

The writing process should look something like this:

1. Create a [new repository on your github account named `<username>.github.io`](https://guides.github.com/features/pages) (with or without a `README.md`)
1. [Turn on GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages)
1. Clone the repository to your computer using GitKraken
1. Open the repository in VSC
1. Open or create the `README.md` file, turn on [Markdown Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dmodalek.markdown-preview-github-styles-custom)
1. Begin writing.  Play around with tables, lists, links, emphasis, ... and there's not really much more to Markdown!

This make this exercise too difficult! The main goal is to become familiar adding/committing, pushing/pulling, using VSC, and writing clean code.

If you want an extra challenge try adding some extra pages to your site and linking between them.  In the repository this will show up as multiple files above the README, on GitHub Pages this will become a fully navigable web page!

Can you figure out how to make something like a header/navbar using only Markdown?

> Emojis and images won't show up in VSC previews but will show up on GitHub when you push.  If you want to get extra creative by including images or emoji's, you'll need to push your code to GitHub frequently to see how it looks when it's live in the repo.

#### Creating a Live Home Page

[Turn on GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages), that's all you need to do to create a live web page!

After turning on GitHub pages, add this link as your home page on your github user profile (if you don't already have a personal web site).

Looking for a little more flare?  Set [a theme](https://pages.github.com/themes/) for your home page.
