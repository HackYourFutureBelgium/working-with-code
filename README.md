Welcome to Hack Your Future Belgium.  There is a lot of code, links, and browser tabs in your near future!

It'll take a little while to learn how to keep this all organized in your head and on your computer.  As a general rule, if you're not sure how to find something, go to your class wiki.  The wiki will have links to each module, homework table, class notes, and more.  If you're still a bit disoriented, let us know on Slack and someone will help you out!

This module's main objective is to get you comfortable with the workflows of programming, and of Hack Your Future BE.  The finished project won't be complex or impressive to the casual observer, but in order for you to complete it you will need to have a basic overview of the entire development process.  Including: ideation, local development, pushing and pulling to github, and hosting static web pages.
