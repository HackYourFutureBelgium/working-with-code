## How to HYF

There are a lot of code, links, and browser tabs in your near future!

It'll take a little while to learn how to keep this all organized in your head and on your computer.  As a general rule, if you're not sure how to find something, go to your class wiki.  The wiki will have links to each module, homework table, class notes, and more.  If you're still a bit disoriented, let us know on Slack and someone will help you out!

To help you along the way here are some more helpful links:

* [Student Handbook](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/student-handbook)
* [Homework Submission](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/homework-submission)
* [Curriculum Overview](https://hackyourfuturebelgium.github.io/curriculum)
