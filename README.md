Welcome to Hack Your Future Belgium. There is a lot of code, links, and browser tabs in your near future!

It'll take a little while to learn how to keep this all organized in your head and on your computer.  If you're having trouble finding something, take a look through the links in your class repository. If you still cant find it, ask your classmates on Slack and someone will help you out!

This module's main objective is to get you comfortable with the workflows of programming and of Hack Your Future BE. The finished project won't be complex or impressive to the casual observer, but in order for you to complete it you will need to have a basic overview of the entire development process. Including: ideation, local development, pushing and pulling to github, and hosting static web pages.

## Week 1

### Prep work

> before class

- Review [the HYF Be Precourse](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/curriculum/precourse), come ready with any questions!
- Watch at least the first 3 videos of [Git & GitHub for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV). This is an outstanding video series that will help you understand why you need Git & GitHub, with no code!
- Familiarize yourself with [HYF Individual Assignments](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/students/individual-assignments).
- [Markdown CheatSheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)
- Group Repo Examples
  - [HackYourFutureBelgium](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/group-intro-example)
  - [LujiAnne](https://github.com/LujiAnna/group-intro)
  - [okozmovskaya](https://github.com/okozmovskaya/group-intro)
  - [sayed94h](https://github.com/sayed94h/Group-Intro-LetItBe)
- [relative vs. absolute paths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ephId3mYu9o)

### Lesson Plan

> during class

#### Before Break

Get to know your group and your local programming environment by writing and a folder of Markdown files.  By break time each of you should have created a new directory in your computer just for HackYourFuture, and one new folder inside it containing a short intro to each member of your group.  It should look something like this, but hopefully a little nicer ;)

- [Example Repo](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/group-intro-example)

Writing code is still writing!
Take the time to proof read and edit your code. Your colleagues and your future self will thank you. Practice using the VSC plugins you installed with the Precourse to write correct markdown:

- Correct your spelling with Code Spell Checker
- Format your code with Prettier
- Fix any linting errors
- Preview the rendered Markdown, does it look like you wanted?

#### After Break

Create a repository on your GitHub account and push your new markdown folder to GitHub, finally turn on GitHub Pages for a live preview:

- [Example Live](https://hackyourfuture.be/group-intro-example)

You may use the Terminal or GitKraken for this, whatever you find easier.

## Homework

> after class

Before moving on, you will need to create an `individual` issue for this module:
- [New Issue] in the issues tab of your class repo
- Use the _individual_ template
- More details in the [student guidebook](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/students/individual-assignments#individual-issues)

Here's a checklist you can paste into your issue to track your progress:

```markdown
- [ ] [Profile README](https://github.com/your-user-name)
- [ ] [Home Page](https://your-user-name.github.io)
- [ ] `/hack-my-future` directory on your computer (for keeping your work organized)
```

### GitHub Profile README

Create a GitHub Profile README for your public profile:

- [How to Make One](https://www.aboutmonica.com/blog/how-to-create-a-github-profile-readme)
- [Adding real-time stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)
- [Inspiration](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme)

### Personal Home Page

Create a home page using markdown (or HTML/CSS if you're tempted ;) in the `your-user-name.github.io` repository on your GitHub account. Later on you can turn this repository into an amazing portfolio web site, but for now stick with the basics :)

**Writing The Documents**

The writing process should look something like this:

1. Create a [new repository on your github account named `your-user-name.github.io`](https://guides.github.com/features/pages) (with or without a `README.md`)
1. [Turn on GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages)
1. Clone the repository to your computer (using CLI or GitKraken)
1. Open the repository in VSC
1. Open or create the `README.md` file, turn on [Markdown Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dmodalek.markdown-preview-github-styles-custom)
1. Begin writing. Play around with tables, lists, links, emphasis, ... and there's not really much more to Markdown!

Don't make this exercise too difficult! The main goal is to become familiar adding/committing, pushing/pulling, using VSC, and writing clean code.

If you want an extra challenge try adding some extra pages to your site and linking between them. In the repository this will show up as multiple files above the README, on GitHub Pages this will become a fully navigable web page!

Can you figure out how to make something like a header/navbar using only Markdown?

> Emojis and images won't show up in VSC previews but will show up on GitHub when you push. If you want to get extra creative by including images or emoji's, you'll need to push your code to GitHub frequently to see how it looks when it's live in the repo.

**Creating Your Live Home Page**

[Turn on GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages), that's all you need to do to create a live web page!

After turning on GitHub pages, add this link as your home page on your github user profile (if you don't already have a personal web site).

Looking for a little more flare? Set [a theme](https://pages.github.com/themes/) for your home page. (this will only work if you wrote your page in Markdown, not HTML)
